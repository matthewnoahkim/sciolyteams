# Event-to-Stream Feature: Quick Usage Guide

## ✨ What's New?

When captains create events for the entire club or a team, a modal now asks if they want to post the event to the stream with automatic RSVP functionality!

## 🚀 How to Use

### Creating an Event with Stream Announcement

   ☑ Send email notification to everyone (optional)
   
   [Skip]  [Post to Stream]
   ```
