# Attendance System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Complete Implementation

A comprehensive attendance system has been successfully implemented for your Science Olympiad teams platform. The system automatically tracks attendance for team and subteam events with secure, time-based check-ins.

---

## 📋 What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

**Three new models added:**

#### `Attendance`
- Links to CalendarEvent (one-to-one)
- Stores hashed attendance codes (bcrypt)
- Tracks status: UPCOMING, ACTIVE, ENDED, CANCELLED
- Configurable grace period (default: 0 minutes)
- Indexes for performance on teamId, status

#### `AttendanceCheckIn`
- Records individual member check-ins
- Tracks source (CODE or MANUAL)
- Stores check-in timestamp
- Links to User and Membership
- Unique constraint: one check-in per user per event

#### `AttendanceCodeAttempt`
- Rate limiting implementation
- Tracks success/failure of code attempts
- Records user ID and IP address
- Time-indexed for efficient cleanup

**Relations updated:**
- `User` → `attendanceCheckIns`
- `Membership` → `attendanceCheckIns`
- `CalendarEvent` → `attendance`

---

### 2. Utility Library (`src/lib/attendance.ts`)

**Core functions:**
- `generateAttendanceCode()` - Creates 8-char alphanumeric codes
- `hashAttendanceCode()` - Bcrypt hashing for security
- `verifyAttendanceCode()` - Secure code verification
- `isWithinMeetingWindow()` - Time-based access control
- `calculateAttendanceStatus()` - Auto-status calculation
- `checkRateLimit()` - Prevents brute force (5 attempts/5 min)
- `logCodeAttempt()` - Audit trail for attempts
- `getClientIp()` - IP extraction from headers
- `generateAttendanceCSV()` - CSV export formatting
- `updateAttendanceStatuses()` - Batch status updates

---

### 3. API Routes

**Main attendance endpoint:**
- `GET /api/attendance?teamId=xxx` - List all attendance events
  - Auto-updates statuses before returning
  - Members see only their check-in status
  - Captains see full roster

**Individual attendance operations:**
- `GET /api/attendance/[id]` - Get attendance details
- `GET /api/attendance/[id]/code` - Check if code can be revealed
- `POST /api/attendance/[id]/code/regenerate` - Generate new code (captains only)
- `POST /api/attendance/[id]/checkin` - Member check-in with code
- `GET /api/attendance/[id]/roster` - Full roster with missing members (captains only)
- `GET /api/attendance/[id]/export` - CSV export (captains only)
- `POST /api/attendance/[id]/manual-checkin` - Add manual check-in (captains only)

**Security on every endpoint:**
- Session authentication required
- Team membership verification
- Role-based access control (captain vs member)
- Rate limiting on check-in endpoint
- Input validation with Zod schemas

---

### 4. UI Components

**New Attendance Tab** (`src/components/tabs/attendance-tab.tsx`)

**Features for all members:**
- List of all attendance events with status badges
- Event details (time, location, scope)
- Check-in count visibility
- "Check In" button when event is active
- Personal check-in status display
- Real-time status updates

**Additional captain features:**
- "Generate New Code" button during meeting window
- Large, readable code display
- Full attendance roster with avatars
- Split view: checked in vs. not checked in
- Manual check-in dialog with reason tracking
- "Export CSV" button
- Missing members list

**UI Elements:**
- Status badges (color-coded: blue=upcoming, green=active, gray=ended)
- Event cards with icons (Clock, MapPin, Users)
- Check-in dialog with code input
- Details dialog with expandable sections
- Manual check-in form with dropdowns

---

### 5. Navigation Integration (`src/components/team-page.tsx`)

**Added:**
- New "Attendance" tab in team navigation sidebar
- ClipboardCheck icon for visual identification
- Proper routing with URL params
- Tab state persistence

---

### 6. Automatic Record Creation (`src/app/api/calendar/route.ts`)

**Event creation hook:**
When a captain creates a TEAM or SUBTEAM event:
1. Calendar event is created
2. Attendance record is automatically generated
3. Initial code is created and hashed
4. Status set to UPCOMING
5. Default grace period applied (0 minutes)

Personal events do NOT create attendance records.

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### Code Security
✅ Bcrypt hashing with salt (10 rounds)
✅ Codes never stored in plaintext
✅ Codes never logged
✅ Old codes invalidated on regeneration
✅ Only revealed during meeting window

### Rate Limiting
✅ 5 attempts per 5 minutes per user/IP
✅ Tracks both authenticated and IP-based attempts
✅ Exponential backoff (temporary lockout)
✅ Audit trail in database

### Access Control
✅ Server-side role checks on every endpoint
✅ Captain-only operations strictly enforced
✅ Members can only see their own check-in status
✅ Team membership required for all operations

### Input Validation
✅ Zod schemas for all inputs
✅ Code format validation (6-10 characters)
✅ Reason length limits (1-500 chars)
✅ SQL injection prevention via Prisma

### Time-Based Security
✅ Check-in only during meeting window + grace
✅ Code reveal only during meeting window + grace
✅ Server-side time calculation (no client trust)
✅ Timezone-aware (UTC storage)

## 📈 CSV Export Format

```csv
eventId,eventTitle,start,end,teamId,memberId,memberName,memberEmail,checkedInAt,source
clx123abc,"Team Practice",2024-01-15T14:00:00.000Z,2024-01-15T16:00:00.000Z,clt456def,clu789ghi,"John Smith",john@example.com,2024-01-15T14:05:23.456Z,code
clx123abc,"Team Practice",2024-01-15T14:00:00.000Z,2024-01-15T16:00:00.000Z,clt456def,clu987jkl,"Jane Doe",jane@example.com,2024-01-15T14:03:12.789Z,manual
```

**Includes:**

## 🛡️ Edge Cases Handled

✅ **Overlapping events**: Separate codes and windows
✅ **Multiple attempts**: First valid check-in kept, duplicates rejected
✅ **Time changes**: Windows recalculate on event update
✅ **Event deletion**: Cascade deletes attendance records
✅ **Late arrivals**: Configurable grace periods
✅ **Code regeneration**: Old codes immediately invalid
✅ **Rate limit exceeded**: Clear error message, temporary lockout
✅ **No network**: Proper error handling and user feedback
✅ **Concurrent check-ins**: Database constraints prevent duplicates

---

## 📚 Dependencies Used

**Already installed:**
- `bcryptjs` (^2.4.3) - Code hashing
- `@types/bcryptjs` (^2.4.6) - TypeScript types
- `@prisma/client` - Database ORM
- `zod` - Input validation
- `next-auth` - Authentication
- `lucide-react` - Icons

---

## 🎯 Requirements Met

### From Original Spec:

✅ **Auto-list events on Attendance page**
- All TEAM/SUBTEAM events automatically appear
- Status calculation: upcoming → active → ended
- Attendance records created on event creation

✅ **Event code management**
- 8-character alphanumeric codes (A-Z, 0-9)
- Stored as bcrypt hash only
- Revealed only during meeting hours + grace
- Regeneration invalidates previous codes

✅ **Check-in functionality**
- Code entry during meeting hours only
- First check-in time preserved
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
- Manual check-in with reason (captains only)

✅ **Visibility & Export**
- Captains see full rosters
- Members see only their status
- CSV export with all required fields
- Proper column headers and formatting

✅ **Security & Compliance**
- Server-side role checks everywhere
- No plaintext code storage/logging
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- CSRF protection via NextAuth
- Input validation with Zod
- UTC storage, timezone-aware calculations

✅ **Edge cases**
- Configurable grace periods
- Overlapping events handled
- Recurring events (each separate)
- Event update propagation
- Cancelled events block check-in

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **For best results**: Set events to start at the actual meeting time. The system will handle the timing automatically.

2. **Grace periods**: Can be customized per event in the database if needed (default is 0 for strict timing).

3. **Code sharing**: Captains should only share codes verbally or via secure channels during the actual meeting.

4. **Rate limits**: If a member is locked out, they can wait 5 minutes or contact a captain for manual check-in.

5. **CSV exports**: Download attendance data regularly for record-keeping and reporting.
