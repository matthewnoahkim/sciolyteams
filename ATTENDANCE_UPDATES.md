# Attendance System Updates

## Changes Made (Latest)

### 1. ✅ Manual Check-In - Reason is Optional

**What changed:**
- The "reason" field is now **optional** when captains add manual check-ins
- Captains can quickly add someone without needing to provide a reason

**Technical changes:**
- API validation schema updated to make `reason` optional
- UI updated: field labeled "Reason (optional)" and no longer required
- Submit button enabled as long as a user is selected

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/api/attendance/[attendanceId]/manual-checkin/route.ts`
- `src/components/tabs/attendance-tab.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Captains Can Undo Check-Ins

**What changed:**
- Captains can now **delete any check-in** from the roster
- Small trash icon appears next to each checked-in member
- Useful for correcting mistakes or removing invalid check-ins

**Technical changes:**
- New DELETE endpoint: `/api/attendance/[attendanceId]/checkin/[checkInId]`
- Captain-only access with proper authorization
- UI updates immediately after deletion
- Toast notification confirms removal

**How to use:**
1. Captain opens event details in Attendance tab
2. Views the roster of checked-in members
3. Clicks the trash icon next to any member's name
4. Check-in is removed and roster updates

**Files created:**
- `src/app/api/attendance/[attendanceId]/checkin/[checkInId]/route.ts` (NEW)

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/tabs/attendance-tab.tsx`

---

### 3. ✅ Captains Can Generate Codes Before Meetings

**What changed:**
- Captains can now generate attendance codes for **UPCOMING** events (not just ACTIVE)
- Allows pre-meeting preparation and planning
- Code can be generated hours or days before the meeting
- Members still can only check in during the actual meeting window

**Benefits:**
- Captain can prepare the code in advance
- Reduces stress during meeting start
- Code is ready when meeting begins
- Still secure - members can't check in early

**Technical changes:**
- Removed time window restriction on code generation endpoint
- Updated UI to show "Generate New Code" button for UPCOMING events
- Added contextual message: "Code generated. Share with attendees when meeting starts."

**Timeline:**
```
UPCOMING: Captain can generate code, members cannot check in
    ↓
ACTIVE: Captain can regenerate code, members can check in
    ↓
ENDED: No code generation, no check-ins
```

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/api/attendance/[attendanceId]/code/regenerate/route.ts`
- `src/components/tabs/attendance-tab.tsx`

## Summary of All Changes

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Manual Check-In Reason | Required | Optional |
| Delete Check-Ins | Not possible | Captains can delete any check-in |
| Code Generation Window | Only during active meeting | Anytime for upcoming/active events |

## API Endpoints Updated

### Modified Endpoints

**POST /api/attendance/[attendanceId]/manual-checkin**
```json
// Before: reason required
{
  "userId": "string",
  "reason": "string" // REQUIRED
}

// After: reason optional
{
  "userId": "string",
  "reason": "string" // OPTIONAL
}
```

**POST /api/attendance/[attendanceId]/code/regenerate**
- Before: Only allowed during meeting window (ACTIVE status)
- After: Allowed for UPCOMING and ACTIVE events

### New Endpoint

**DELETE /api/attendance/[attendanceId]/checkin/[checkInId]**
- **Authorization**: Captain only
- **Purpose**: Remove a check-in record
- **Response**: Success message with removed user info
- **Effect**: Updates roster immediately

---

## UI Changes

### Attendance Details Dialog - Captain View

**Added:**
1. **Trash icon button** next to each checked-in member
   - Small red trash icon
   - Shows loading state when deleting
   - Positioned on the right side of roster entries

2. **Improved code generation messaging**
   - "Code generated. Share with attendees when meeting starts." (for UPCOMING)
   - "Share this code with attendees during the meeting" (for ACTIVE)

3. **"Generate New Code" button visibility**
   - Now visible for both UPCOMING and ACTIVE events
   - Was previously only for ACTIVE events

### Manual Check-In Dialog

**Changed:**
- "Reason" label changed to "Reason (optional)"
- Field no longer required
- Submit button enabled with just user selection
- Reason field still available if captain wants to document

---

## Security Considerations

### Delete Check-In
✅ **Authorization**: Server-side captain verification
✅ **Validation**: Checks that check-in belongs to specified attendance
✅ **Audit Trail**: Check-in record is deleted (consider logging if needed)

### Pre-Meeting Code Generation
✅ **Members still can't check in early**: Time window check remains for check-in endpoint
✅ **Code security maintained**: Still hashed, never in plaintext
✅ **Captain-only access**: Only captains can generate codes

### Optional Reason
✅ **No security impact**: Reason was never required for security
✅ **Data integrity maintained**: Reason stored when provided
✅ **Audit capability**: Manual check-ins still identifiable by source field

## Migration Notes

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Meeting Preparation
```
9:00 AM - Meeting scheduled for 2:00 PM
Captain generates code: "ABC12345"
Code is displayed with message about waiting

2:00 PM - Meeting starts (becomes ACTIVE)
Captain shares code "ABC12345" verbally
Members can now check in with the code
```

### Example 2: Quick Manual Check-In
```
Captain: "John was here but his phone died"
1. Opens manual check-in dialog
2. Selects John from dropdown
3. Clicks "Add Check-In" (no reason needed)
4. John appears in roster with "Manual" badge
```

### Example 3: Correcting a Mistake
```
Captain: "Jane checked in on wrong event"
1. Opens event details
2. Finds Jane in checked-in list
3. Clicks trash icon next to Jane's name
4. Jane's check-in is removed
5. Jane can now check in to correct event
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

1. **Manual check-in reason optional** → Make `reason` required again in schema
2. **Delete check-in** → Remove the DELETE endpoint and UI buttons
3. **Pre-meeting code generation** → Add back time window check in regenerate endpoint

All changes are isolated and can be reverted independently.

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Deletion logging**: Keep audit trail of deleted check-ins
- **Bulk delete**: Remove multiple check-ins at once
- **Transfer check-in**: Move check-in between events
- **Code history**: Show all codes generated for an event
- **Code preview**: Show code without generating new one
- **Schedule code generation**: Auto-generate at specific time

### User Feedback Welcome
These changes were made based on user requests. Continue to gather feedback on:
- Is optional reason better or should we require it?
- Are captains using pre-meeting code generation?
- How often are check-ins being deleted?
- Should there be limits on deletion?
